# Cat-or-Dog-Image-Classifier
developed with Google colab


Below is a structured README.md file format that you could use to describe the Cat or Dog classification project based on the TensorFlow notebook content you provided:

Cat or Dog Image Classifier
This project is an implementation of a binary image classifier to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. It leverages TensorFlow, a powerful library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning, and employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a substantial dataset of cat and dog images.

Installation
Before running the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install opendatasets
Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle and can be downloaded using the opendatasets library. The dataset contains images of cats and dogs, organized into separate training and testing directories.

python
Copy code
import opendatasets as od
od.download('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dineshpiyasamara/cats-and-dogs-for-classification')
Usage
The project includes scripts to preprocess the data, train a CNN model, and evaluate its performance. Data preprocessing includes resizing images to 128x128 pixels and normalizing pixel values.

Model Architecture
The model is built using TensorFlow's Sequential API. It includes several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout, batch normalization, and dense layers, followed by a sigmoid activation function to achieve binary classification.

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization

# Define model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
Training the Model
The model is compiled and trained using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function.

python
Copy code
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(train_data, epochs=30, validation_data=validation_data)
Performance Evaluation
After training, the model's precision, recall, and accuracy are calculated using TensorFlow's metrics functions.

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.metrics import Precision, Recall, BinaryAccuracy

precision = Precision()
recall = Recall()
accuracy = BinaryAccuracy()

# Update states with predictions
for X, y in test_data:
    y_pred = model.predict(X)
    precision.update_state(y, y_pred)
    recall.update_state(y, y_pred)
    accuracy.update_state(y, y_pred)
Visualization
Loss and accuracy graphs are plotted to evaluate the model's performance during training.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot asitemap
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.legend(['Train', 'Val'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
Conclusion
This model demonstrates effective use of convolutional neural networks to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. Future work could explore further optimization of the model architecture and hyperparameters.
