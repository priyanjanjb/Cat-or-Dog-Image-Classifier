1. Setup and Dependencies
Installation of necessary Python packages: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, and opendatasets (for dataset downloading).
Downloading the cats and dogs dataset from Kaggle using the opendatasets library.

2. Preparing the Data
The dataset is organized into training, validation, and test sets.
Images are loaded and batched using TensorFlow utilities, resized to 128x128 pixels.
Data normalization is applied to scale pixel values from 0 to 255 to between 0 and 1.

3. Transfer Learning with Xception Model
Utilization of the Xception model pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor (excluding the top classification layer).
Additional dense layers are added to fine-tune the model for the specific task of distinguishing between cats and dogs.
Layers of the Xception model are frozen to prevent retraining, focusing the training on the newly added layers.

4. Model Compilation and Training
Compilation of the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, suitable for binary classification tasks.
Training the model for 3 epochs, monitoring both training and validation performance.
Notable use of performance metrics during training, including loss and accuracy.

5. Evaluation and Testing
Post-training, the model's precision, recall, and accuracy are calculated on the test dataset to evaluate its performance.
A demonstration of how to use the trained model to make predictions on new images, processing steps include resizing and normalization.

6. Performance Visualization
Graphical representation of training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs, helping visualize the learning process and model convergence.

7. Operational Use
Example showing how to predict the class (cat or dog) of a new image using the trained model, including reading the image, processing it, 
and interpreting the model's output to determine the class.
