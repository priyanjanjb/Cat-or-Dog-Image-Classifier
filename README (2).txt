CCat or Dog Classifier Using Transfer Learning
Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning to classify images of cats and dogs. It uses the Xception model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset as a base model, with additional custom layers to adapt it to the task of binary classification (cats vs. dogs).

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas opendatasets
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be downloaded using the opendatasets Python library. It includes 8,000 training images, 800 validation images, and 2,000 test images, all categorized into two classes: cats and dogs.

python
Copy code
import opendatasets as od
od.download('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dineshpiyasamara/cats-and-dogs-for-classification')
Model Architecture
The model employs the Xception architecture with weights pre-trained on ImageNet. The top of the network is omitted to allow for custom layers specific to this classification task. These layers include a Flatten layer and several Dense layers, with the final output being a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, suitable for binary classification.

Training the Model
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. It is trained for 3 epochs, with a batch size of 32 and image size of 128x128 pixels.

Performance
The training process prints the loss and accuracy after each epoch. Additionally, after training, the model's precision, recall, and binary accuracy are calculated using the test dataset.

Usage
To use the model for prediction, images need to be preprocessed to match the input requirements of the model (128x128 pixels, normalized). The model can then predict if the image is more likely to be a cat or a dog based on the trained weights.

Example Code
python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

img = cv4.imread('path_to_your_image.jpg')
resized_image = tf.image.resize(img, [128, 128])
scaled_image = resized_image / 255.0
expanded_image = np.expand_dims(scaled_image, 0)

prediction = model.predict(expanded_image)
predicted_class = 'dogs' if prediction > 0.5 else 'cats'
print(predicted_class)
Conclusion
This project illustrates the effectiveness of transfer learning for image classification tasks, reducing the need for a large number of training epochs while maintaining high accuracy.
